# GAME menu UI focused verdicts

This related batch follows the menu selection, glyph, input, status, and sprite
families through their shared calls and data. Each row was rebuilt with a
focused `kf try --unit ... --context 0 --no-flow` probe. `SAME` means an
identical focused listing; strict `kf match` closure was not run in this pass.
The source models and curated retail evidence, rather than a fuzzy score,
remain the criteria for retaining changes.

A fresh 30-function focused menu, frame, and notification sweep after the
`menu_sprite_defs` inventory identity sync gave 27 SAME listings and the three
retained WIP results above: `menu_draw_window` 83.5%, `menu_draw_string`
90.4%, and `menu_draw_number` 93.1%. This is a listing probe, not strict
closure. The notification quad's two rectangle groups were also trialed with
the pinned Psy-Q `setXYWH` and `setUVWH` macros; the exact drawing helper
fell to 74.0% and both substitutions were reverted. The retail store order
supports the existing chained assignments, not those macro spellings.
For `menu_draw_number`, hoisting the second atlas-column U value into a
typed byte local reduced the focused listing to 86.0%; reversing its
commutative addition left the 93.1% listing unchanged. Both trial expressions
were reverted. Its remaining two U/width load-order differences and one
prologue move position lack a source-level correction from current evidence.
A later `s32` second-column-U local likewise hoisted the U value and reduced
the focused result to 86.2%; that probe was reverted too.

A later focused 28-function sweep of the glyph-row, input, status,
notification, and transition family gave 25 SAME listings and three retained
DIFF results: `0x8001876c` 90.8%, `0x8001930c` 80.2%, and `0x800349bc`
43.2%. The two additional exact controls in that sweep were
`menu_magic_list` `0x8001a2f4` and `menu_simple_loop` `0x8001a7fc`;
`tim_upload_images` and `func_80034e10` stayed SAME in the transition unit.
No new C source change was retained from this sweep. These are focused
listings, not strict closure.
The adjacent menu-model render helper `0x80033994` also rebuilt SAME in a
separate focused probe; its calls select the menu item TMD and draw object
zero through the shared model path.
The [inline-helper probe ledger](kf2-game-inline-helper-probes.md) records
the controlled macro and out-of-line spelling comparisons for the exact
status, attribute, and notification functions and the WIP glyph renderer.

The early item selector `0x80018ac8` and equipment selector `0x8001a898`
remain SAME after the shared list-input prototype cleanup. The mixed
item/magic controller `0x8001a4f0` remains DIFF 96.0%: its 22 CFG blocks and
12 branches agree, and the only displayed differences are register choices
for the fixed-count initializer's index and constants. A natural `do/while`
spelling emitted the same 96.0% listing as the retained `for` loop, so the
source stayed with the simpler form.

The separate archive-image preview at `0x8001930c` remains DIFF 80.2% in a
normal focused `kf try`. SDK `setXYWH` and `setUVWH` macros express the two
rectangles without changing the listing. Its calls, referents, 47 CFG blocks,
and 27 branches align; the remaining observable differences start with a
64-byte versus 56-byte frame and the archive-entry arithmetic schedule.
The arithmetic expression has been restored after a left-associative probe
failed to improve the instruction order. A separate archive-base local
lowered the focused listing to 79.6% by changing the initial registers;
that expression was also reverted. No compiler mechanism is inferred from
these residues.

The related fade transition at `0x800349bc` draws four `POLY_FT4` rectangles.
The pinned Psy-Q 3.0 `setXYWH` and `setUVWH` macros replace eight equivalent
field-write groups in its source. A normal focused probe retains DIFF 43.2%,
with 14/14 CFG blocks and 8/8 branches; adjacent `tim_upload_images`
(`0x8003494c`) and `func_80034e10` remain SAME. Retail spills the fade state
on a 72-byte frame, while the current 64-byte probe keeps it in a saved
register. The macro substitution changes source expression without claiming
an exact-match gain.
