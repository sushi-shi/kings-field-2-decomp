/*
 * Inventory items, equipment, death drops and map objects share one ID
 * namespace (KF1 KfObjectId). Item use passes the inventory ID unchanged as
 * the scene command (event_scene_command_dispatch), which decrements
 * game_counter_bytes[id] and can store it as a map object's ID
 * (event_spawn_effect_object); pickups increment the counter of the object's
 * own ID; actor death drops spawn map objects by ID. game_counter_bytes
 * covers IDs 0..119; map-object templates extend the namespace to 319, so
 * the domain is a halfword while byte fields keep their byte storage.
 *
 * Weapons are 0..17 (player_weapon_records) and equipment records start at
 * 21. Members without behavioural evidence keep their decimal encoding as a
 * WIP name. Behaviour seen in the consumers: using 77..80 returns an 82,
 * and using 82 at object 195 yields a 77; 84 starts the map-marker effect,
 * 86 and 87 start the full-MP and magic-boost timers, 90..94 unlock spell
 * lists, 99..109 are consumed by map-object markers, 114..116 arm the
 * object-control events of object 189, and weapons 16/17 spend 117/118.
 * The accessory names describe one consumer each: 54 also spends an 83 to
 * survive a fall, and 57 doubles weapon 13's charge.
